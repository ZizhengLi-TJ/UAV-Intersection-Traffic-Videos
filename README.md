# UAV Intersection Traffic Videos

This repository contains high-resolution aerial videos of intersection traffic captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These videos are intended for research purposes, particularly in the areas of traffic flow analysis and vehicle trajectory modeling.

## Overview

- **Dataset Description:** The dataset includes approximately 600 minutes of drone-captured video data from various intersections. The footage provides a comprehensive view of traffic patterns, vehicle movements, and interactions at intersections.

- **Purpose:** These videos are intended to support research and development in traffic management systems, autonomous vehicle testing, and other applications requiring detailed analysis of vehicle behavior in complex urban environments.

- **Data Collection Methodology:** The videos were recorded using advanced drones equipped with high-resolution cameras. An improved YOLOv5 OBB model was used for vehicle detection and trajectory extraction.

## Usage

The data can be used for:

- Traffic flow analysis
- Vehicle trajectory modeling
- Development of AI models for traffic management
